# Lab 4 - Conversational AI with Bot Service using Power Virtual Agents

This lab covers Power Virtual Agents as the hero bot service and demonstrates how to use the Copilot option to create a bot.

## Task 1 - Explore lab scenario

The power of Machine Learning also comes into play when dealing with human-to-machine interfaces. While classical interfaces like native or web applications are ubiquitous, the new approaches based on conversational AI are becoming increasingly popular. Having the capability to interact with intelligent services using natural language is quickly becoming the norm rather than the exception. Using Conversational AI, analysts can find the research of interest by using simple natural language phrases.

With Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), Human Machine Interface (HMI) technologies are enjoying an increased adoption year over year. By 2021, [the growth of chatbots in this space is expected to be 25.07%](https://www.technavio.com/report/chatbot-market-industry-analysis).


The way organizations are building conversational systems is evolving, with bots being built and maintained by a mix of technical and non-technical roles. Power Virtual Agents has the capability to extend its capabilities by allowing pro-code users to create dialogs/topics using the Azure Bot Framework Composer today. This experience allows technical and non-technical teams to build and host their solutions on a single platform.
