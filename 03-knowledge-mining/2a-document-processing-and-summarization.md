# Lab 2a - Document Processing and Summarization with Azure Form Recognizer and Cognitive Service for Language

This lab covers Azure Cognitive Services, particularly [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/) and the [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) service.

## Task 1 - Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the begining of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](../media/data-overview-01-01.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) 💻 of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see `Introducing the updated mobile layout` popup screen, then close it by click on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error in the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

Another critical problem to deal with when it comes to the volumes of research documents covering COVID-19 is the problem of advanced indexing and searching their content. The specific internal structure of research papers (including citations, contributors, and various entities like diagnosis, forms of examination, family relations, genes, medication, symptom or signs, and treatments) form a reach semantic graph that goes way beyond simple document categorization. An analyst would benefit significantly from exploring the corpus of documents in a way that takes all these complex relationships into account.

Using the Cognitive Search capabilities, we will create a complex index of documents that allows an analyst to perform an advanced search and explore the inter-document graph relationships.

The following diagram highlights the portion of the general architecture covered by this lab.

![Architecture for Lab 3](./../media/Architecture-3.png)

The high-level steps covered in the lab are:

- Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data
- Explore lab scenario
- Explore document search process
- Explore graph search process
- Add a set of new documents and trigger the index update process
- Explore the document and graph search and identify updated results

## Task 3 - Creating Azure Search Indexes

1. Navigate to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your credentials.  Then, select **Resource groups**.

    ![Open Azure resource group](media/azure-open-resource-groups.png)

2. Select the **AI-in-a-Day** resource group.

3. Locate **Search service** resource **aiinaday-cog-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, select that.

    ![The Search service is highlighted from the list of services in the AI-in-a-Day Resource Group](media/select-azure-search-service1.png)

4. Copy the search service URL and paste this into a text file.  Also make note of the service account name, which comes before `.search.windows.net`.

    ![The Search service's URL is copied to the clipboard.](media/copy-azure-search-url.png)

5. Navigate to the Keys setting and copy the Primary admin key. Paste this into a text file.

    ![The Search service's API key is copied to the clipboard.](media/lab2-t3-step5.png)

6. Download the `schemas.zip` from https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/raw/main/03-knowledge-mining/schemas.zip. Unzip `schemas.zip`.  There are six files, three prefixed with `abstracts` and three with `covid19temp`.  Save these to a directory such as `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`.

7. Open the `abstracts_datasource.schema` file with a text editor and replace the segment starting `<< TODO:` with your Storage account connection string **<inject key="storageAccountConnectionString" enableCopy="true"/>** and then save the file.  Do the same for `covid19temp_datasource.schema`.

    ![The abstract data source is ready to be updated.](media/edit-abstracts-datasource.png)

8. Open a new PowerShell prompt.  Navigate to following directory `cd C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`. Enter the following code, which will create an Azure Search data source, index, and indexer.

    ```powershell
    function Create-AzureSearchIndex {
        param
        (
            [string]$DataSourceFilePath,
            [string]$IndexFilePath,
            [string]$IndexerFilePath,
            [string]$AccountName,
            [string]$ApiKey
        )
        
        $Header = @{
            "api-key" = $ApiKey
        }
        $BaseUri = "https://" + $AccountName + ".search.windows.net"
        
        # Create Data Source
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/datasources?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $DataSourceFilePath
        
        # Create Index
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/indexes?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $IndexFilePath
        
        # Create Indexer
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/indexers?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $IndexerFilePath
    }
    ```

    ![The Create-AzureSearchIndex function has been created in PowerShell.](media/create-azuresearchindex.png)

9. In the same PowerShell prompt, call this function for the `abstracts` index and for the `covid19temp` index.  Then, fill in your Azure Search account name and Azure Search API key.
    - Azure Search Account Name: **aiinaday-cog-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - Azure Search API key: You saved Primary admin key in text editor in step 5, use that

    ```powershell
    Create-AzureSearchIndex "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_datasource.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_indexer.schema" "AZURE SEARCH ACCOUNT NAME" "API KEY"

    Create-AzureSearchIndex "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp_datasource.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp_indexer.schema" "AZURE SEARCH ACCOUNT NAME" "API KEY"
    ```

    ![The Create-AzureSearchIndex function has been run to create a new index.](media/create-azuresearchindex-use.png)

## Task 4 - Querying Azure Search Indexes

    ![Articles with the phrase RNA intereference.](media/search-explorer-rna-interference.png)

7. We can also see how many articles match a certain search string.  In the Query string input box, enter the phrase `Brazil&$count=true` and then select **Search**.  This will return 53 documents.

    ![53 articles reference Brazil.](media/search-explorer-brazil-1.png)

8. Each document returns a large number of fields, but we can specify the fields we would like to see.  In the Query string input box, enter the phrase `UNC Chapel Hill&$select=metadata/authors, metadata/title` and then select **Search**.  This will return the title as well as detailed information on each author.

    ![Paper titles and authors referencing UNC Chapel Hill.](media/search-explorer-unc.png)

9. The Azure Search service can also generate a demo application.  Return to the search service and select the **covid19temp** index.

    ![The covid19temp index is selected.](media/azure-search-indexes-covid19temp.png)

14. Review the detials and click on **Create project**.

    ![Project](media/lab2a-t6-frs6.png)
  
15. After creating a new project, you will be sent to the project for tagging in Label data. Select **+**(1) to create a new **Field**(2), type `Abstract` in the Field and hit enter. By this you have created a new Abstract Field.

    ![The Abstract tag has been created](media/lab2a-t6-frs8.png)
    
    ![The Abstract tag has been created](media/lab2a-t6-frs9.png)

16. Wait for the layout to be run for the first document and locate the document's abstract.  Note that for some documents, the abstract is on the second page.  Then, move on to the next document.  We will tag each of the five papers, so navigate to each in turn, allowing the layout to be run.  In order for tagging to be successful, we must first run the layout of a document, navigate to another document, and return to this first document before we begin tagging.  Layout generation happens once per document, after which point we can return to it and tag our abstract.

    ![Running layout for a document](media/lab2a-t6-frs7.png)

17. Return to the second PDF and select each word in the **Abstract** section.  After highlighting this, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this section.  Note that you will need to select each word individually rather than selecting a box.  After selecting the **Abstract** tag, you should see a tag logo next to the PDF.  If you see the tag logo, this means that tagging was successful for this document.

    ![The first PDF has been viewed, and the second PDF has been tagged](media/lab2a-t6-frs10.png)

18. Return to the first PDF and highlight the word **ABSTRACT** as well as the abstract.  If the abstract is lengthy, as in this example, it is okay to include just the first paragraph.  Then, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this document.  Ensure that the viewed icon (an eye) changes to a tag icon.  If it does not change to a tag but instead changes to a blank spot without any icons, tagging was unsuccessful.  In the event that tagging is unsuccessful, select another document, wait for it to have its layout run, and then return to the prior document and try tagging again.

    ![The first PDF has been tagged](media/lab2a-t6-frs11.png)

19. Continue tagging until all five of the top papers are tagged. Once we have tagged five documents, then select the **Train** option.
    
    ![The first five PDFs have been tagged](media/lab2a-t6-frs12.png)

20. In a pop-up to Train a new model, enter **Abstracts** as the ModelID, and select the **Neural** from the drop-down as Build Mode. Then click on **Train**.

    ![The option to train a model has been selected](media/lab2a-t6-frs13.png)

21. Training a model may take up to 10-15 minustes to get succeed. Click on **Go to models**. 

    ![The option to train a model has been selected](media/lab2a-t6-frs14.png)

22. After the model has finished training, you will see that Status as succeeded.  Although the estimated accuracy is not great, we will use this model.

    ![The Abstracts model has been trained](media/lab2a-t6-frs15.png)

23. From the left menu, select the **Test**(1). Click on **+ Add**(2) and navigate to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` and select `2020.09.25.20201616v1.pdf`. Select **Analyze**(3) to see the results. Note that the abstract is on page 2 of the PDF.

    ![An analyzed document](media/lab2a-t6-frs16.png)

24. Select **Result** and click on **download icon** to download JSON file. We will use this script in the next task. Find the location where the script was downloaded and move it to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`.

    ![An analyzed document](media/lab2a-t6-frs19.png)

25. Select **Code** and click on **download icon** to download a Python script. We will use this script in the next task. Find the location where the script was downloaded and move it to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`.

    ![The option to download an analysis script is selected](media/lab2a-t6-frs17.png)

## Task 7 - Document Summarization via Cognitive Service for Language integration

1. In the labvm, open a command prompt (`cmd.exe`).  To do this, open the Windows menu, type in `cmd`, and select the **Command Prompt** application.

    ![The Command Prompt application is selected](media/open-cmd.png)

2. Run the below command.  To run this, you must have Python installed on the machine.  If `python.exe` is not accessible as part of the path--meaning you get an error when trying to run `pip`, navigate to where Python is installed.  The `pip.exe` program is inside the `\Scripts\` folder.

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0b1
    ```

    ![Pip has installed the azureai text analytics package for Python](media/lab2a-t7-pip-azureai.png)

3. Create a new file named **summarization.py** in the location `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` and add the below code in the file. Make sure to replace the **Key** and the **Endpoint** of the Cognitive services multi-service account **aiinaday-cogsv<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** which you have copied to text file in the previous tasks.

   ```bash
   key = "paste-your-key-here"
   endpoint = "paste-your-endpoint-here"

   from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
   from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

   # Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
   def authenticate_client():
       ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
       text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
               endpoint=endpoint, 
               credential=ta_credential)
       return text_analytics_client

    client = authenticate_client()

    # Example method for summarizing text
    def sample_extractive_summarization(client):
        from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
        from azure.ai.textanalytics import (
            TextAnalyticsClient,
            ExtractSummaryAction
        ) 

        document = [
           "The extractive summarization feature uses natural language processing techniques to locate key sentences in an unstructured text document. "
           "These sentences collectively convey the main idea of the document. This feature is provided as an API for developers. " 
           "They can use it to build intelligent solutions based on the relevant information extracted to support various use cases. "
           "In the public preview, extractive summarization supports several languages. It is based on pretrained multilingual transformer models, part of our quest for holistic representations. "
           "It draws its strength from transfer learning across monolingual and harness the shared nature of languages to produce models of improved quality and efficiency. "
         ]

         poller = client.begin_analyze_actions(
             document,
             actions=[
                 ExtractSummaryAction(max_sentence_count=4)
             ],
         )

         document_results = poller.result()
         for result in document_results:
             extract_summary_result = result[0]  # first document, first result
             if extract_summary_result.is_error:
                print("...Is an error with code '{}' and message '{}'".format(
                    extract_summary_result.code, extract_summary_result.message
                ))
            else:
                print("Summary extracted: \n{}".format(
                    " ".join([sentence.text for sentence in extract_summary_result.sentences]))
                )

    sample_extractive_summarization(client)
    ```
    
   ![summarization](media/lab2a-t7-summarization.png) 

5. Navigate to command prompt and run the following commands.

   ```bash
